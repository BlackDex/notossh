WHATEVER

that code is a quick and dirty hack to get notifications over ssh from my server
running irssi to my workstation. Aimed to be extended with other notification
systems.

for original notify.pl code :

INSTALL

-- REMOTE SHELL running IRSSI --
1/	copy 'notify.pl' to your ~/.irssi/scripts folder
	i.e. scp notify.pl REMOTE:.irssi/scripts
2/	do '/load perl' and '/script load notify.pl' in irssi
	- TIP: Add it to your irssi conf to auto load
	e.g.
3/	Ensure SSH allows remote tunnels - i.e. GatewayPorts yes
4/	configure the 'highlights' in your client. (if you don't know how RTFM !)
	- /hilight -regex bla|bla

-- Local SSH Client --
1/ 	cd irssi-over-ssh-notifications
2/	Edit irssi-over-ssh-notifications.sh to have correct SSH server, port, BASE dir for scripts 
	(e.g. dir in PATH) etc.
3/ 	./irssi-over-ssh-notifications.sh install - Will copy to BASE in script
4/	OPTIONAL: Add CONFIGURATION from below to automate things ... 
5/	irssi-over-ssh-notifications.sh startall
		- irssi-over-ssh-notifications.sh stop (will turn off daemon AND ssh tunnel)
6/	if you don't like it as is... HACK IT !

TODO

 * test it with libnotify (only tested with growl for now)
	- Growl can pass through to libnotify
 * test every kind of output. 
 * Make it easier to format output.

OPTIONS

irssi-notify-listener.py                starts the server as daemon
irssi-notify-listener.py --sticky       make Growl notifications sticky
irssi-notify-listener.py --stop         stops the running daemon
irssi-notify-listener.py --foreground   runs the server in foreground
irssi-notify-listener.py --help         displays help

Some variables can be changed, Use The Source, Luke. (host and port)
That code is aimed to be hacked.

CONFIGURATION

add to your .ssh/config those lines, where HOST is the host you want to connect to :

Host HOST
PermitLocalCommand yes
LocalCommand /path/to/bin/irssi-notify-listener.py
RemoteForward 4222 localhost:4222

NOTIFICATIONS

to change the way notifications behaves, like on Fedora systems, you can change the notification
line to the following, making it transient :

return [NOTIFIER_DBUS, '--hint', 'int:transient:1', '-i', 'dialog-information', '-t', '5000', ':'.join(args[1:]), args[0]]

LICENCES

notify.pl is under GPL (because I copy/pasted it from some guy whose name is inside that code)
everything else is WTFPL (because I don't care what you do with it, but if you don't 
tell me you've upgraded it, you're just a moron)

And if you like it, buy me a beer !
