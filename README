WHATEVER

that code is a quick and dirty hack to get notifications over ssh from my server
running irssi to my workstation. Aimed to be extended with other notification
systems.

 * http://github.com/guyzmo/irssi-over-ssh-notifications

for original notify.pl code :

 * http://lewk.org/log/code/irssi-notify

INSTALL

1/ copy 'irssi-notify-listener.py' on your client system (i.e. where you've got 
    your GUI and want the notifications to be shown)
2/ copy 'notify.pl' to your ~/.irssi/scripts folder
3/ copy 'notify-send' somewhere in the path of the same box where notify.pl is.
4/ be sure notify-send and irssi-notify-listener.py are chmod +x
5/ launch irssi-notify-listener.py on your client system (with nohup > /dev/null
    can be a neat idea... it has no output)
6/ from your client system do ssh user@myserver -R 4222:localhost:4222 (it can also 
    be set in ssh_config)
7/ do '/load perl' and '/script load notify.pl' in irssi
8/ configure the 'highlights' in your client. (if you don't know how RTFM !)
9/ if you don't like it... HACK IT !

TODO

 * test it with libnotify (only tested with growl for now)
 * merge notify-send and notify.pl (check notify.pl source) so notify.pl sends itself the notifications

OPTIONS

there are no options. Some variables can be changed, UTSL. That code is aimed to be hacked.

LICENCES

notify.pl is under GPL (because I copy/pasted it from some guy whose name is inside that code)
everything else is WTFPL (because I don't care what you do with it, but if you don't 
tell me you've upgraded it, you're a moron)

And if you like it, buy me a beer !
