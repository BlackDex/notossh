WHATEVER

that code is a quick and dirty hack to get notifications over ssh from my server
running irssi to my workstation. Aimed to be extended with other notification
systems.

 * http://github.com/guyzmo/irssi-over-ssh-notifications

for original notify.pl code :

 * http://lewk.org/log/code/irssi-notify

INSTALL

1/ copy 'irssi-notify-listener.py' on your client system (i.e. where you've got 
    your GUI and want the notifications to be shown)
2/ copy 'notify.pl' to your ~/.irssi/scripts folder
3/ be sure irssi-notify-listener.py is chmod +x
4/ launch irssi-notify-listener.py on your client system
5/ from your client system do ssh user@myserver -R 4222:localhost:4222 (it can also 
    be set in ssh_config, RTFM)
6/ do '/load perl' and '/script load notify.pl' in irssi
7/ configure the 'highlights' in your client. (if you don't know how RTFM !)
8/ if you don't like it as is... HACK IT !

TODO

 * test it with libnotify (only tested with growl for now)
 * test every kind of output. 
 * Make it easier to format output.

OPTIONS

irssi-notify-listener.py                starts the server as daemon
irssi-notify-listener.py --stop         stops the running daemon
irssi-notify-listener.py --foreground   runs the server in foreground
irssi-notify-listener.py --help         displays help

Some variables can be changed, Use The Source, Luke. (host and port)
That code is aimed to be hacked.

LICENCES

notify.pl is under GPL (because I copy/pasted it from some guy whose name is inside that code)
everything else is WTFPL (because I don't care what you do with it, but if you don't 
tell me you've upgraded it, you're just a moron)

And if you like it, buy me a beer !
