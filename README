INSTALL

1/ copy 'irssi-notify-listener.py' on your client system (i.e. where you've got 
    your GUI and want the notifications to be shown)
2/ copy 'notify.pl' to your ~/.irssi/scripts folder
3/ copy 'notify-send' somewhere in the path of the same box where notify.pl is.
4/ be sure notify-send and irssi-notify-listener.py are chmod +x
5/ launch irssi-notify-listener.py on your client system (with nohup can be a nice idea... it has no output)
6/ from your client system do ssh user@myserver -R 4222:localhost:4222
7/ do '/load perl' and '/script load notify.pl' in irssi
8/ configure the 'highlights' in your client. (if you don't know how RTFM !)
9/ if you don't like it... HACK IT !

OPTIONS

there are no options. Some variables can be changed, UTSL. And it can be hacked.

LICENCES

notify.pl is under GPL (because I copy/pasted it from some guy whose name is inside that code)
everything else is WTFPL (because I don't care what you do with it, but if you don't 
tell me you've upgraded it, you're a moron)
